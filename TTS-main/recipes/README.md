# 🐸💬 TTS Training Recipes

TTS recipes intended to host bash scripts running all the necessary steps to train a TTS model with a particular dataset.

Run each script from the root TTS folder as follows

```console
$ bash ./recipes/<dataset>/<model>/run.sh
```

All the outputs are held under the recipe directory unless you change the paths in the bash script.

If you train a new model using TTS, feel free to share your training to expand the list of recipes.
