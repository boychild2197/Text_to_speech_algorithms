    "message": "Talkie是在2016/ Talkie年新年前几天，在朋友的挑战下开发的。挑战始于以下问题：通勤上班时，是否可以听文章而不是阅读文章？我说，很容易，然后开始证明这一点-或至少让我的浏览器使用愚蠢的计算机语音朗读文本。没有任何用户界面的基本版创建起来很简单。添加用户界面需要花费更长的时间。添加适当的语言检测还有更多代码。克服浏览器中的错误甚至可以做更多的工作。改进和功能列表不胜枚举-几千年后的代码，您正在寻找最终结果。",
    "original": "Talkie was developed a few days before the New Year 2016/2017, on a challenge from a friend. The challenge started with the question: while commuting to work, is it possible to listen to an article instead of reading it? Easy, I said, and set out to prove it — or at least to make my browser speak out text using a silly computer voice. The basic edition, without any user interface, turned out to be trivial to create. Adding a user interface, took a bit longer. Adding proper language detection a bunch more code. Overcoming bugs in the browser even more work. The list of improvements and features goes on — and a few thousand lines of code later, you're looking at the end result."
