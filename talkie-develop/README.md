## Notes

<details>
<summary>Web Speech API</summary>

Uses your browser's built-in [Web Speech API for text-to-speech (TTS)](https://www.w3.org/community/speech-api/) known as [Speech Synthesis](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/9a0075d25326/speechapi.html#tts-section).

- As the Web Speech API is implemented by your browser, your browser selection and settings may affect Talkie.
- All text and speech is processed internally by your browser. While ultimately depending on your specific browser, processing is expected to be done on your own machine and not use a server.
- Sound is only produced, never recorded.

</details>



<details>
<summary>Language detection</summary>

Not all languages are supported; consult your browser's voice documentation.

The language detection is performed in four steps, where the first valid value is chosen. If no language was detected, a notice is spoken (in English).

1. Your browser's text language detection for the selection, using word and sentence analysis.
1. The first available `lang="..."` attribute from the selected text's parent HTML elements.
1. The `lang="..."` attribute from the HTML root element of the current page (or frame).
1. Your browser's page primary language detection.

The Web Speech API can use more than one voice per language (currently over 20 for `en-US` in Google Chrome version 55), as well as modify speech rate (speed) and pitch. These options have been implemented in <img src="./resources/icon/premium/icon-play/icon-32x32.png" alt="Talkie Premium's icon" width="16" height="16" border="0" /> Talkie Premium as a paid feature.

</details>



<details>
<summary>Installing voices</summary>

The voices for each language are provided by your browser. For this reason the list may differ depending on your browser, browser version, operating system, and any other installed extensions/software.

To see the list of languages/voices available in your specific browser, as well as speak out sample text, check the Talkie options page after installation. This is a good start in figuring out why a certain language might not be read out loud as expected.

You can install additional voices to support new languages and dialects; see separate installation instructions for your operating system.
